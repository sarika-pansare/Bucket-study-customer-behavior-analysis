# Bucket-study-customer-behavior-analysis

Customer data analysis project using Python to explore purchasing behavior, top products, revenue trends, and customer lifetime value.

**1. Project Description**

      The Customer Behavior Analysis Project is designed to analyze an e-commerce dataset to understand customer purchasing patterns,
       product popularity, sales trends, and customer lifetime value (CLV).
      The goal is to provide actionable insights for business decisions such as targeted marketing, inventory planning, and customer retention strategies.
      
 ** 3. Features******

      Analyze customer purchase frequency and identify frequent, occasional, and one-time buyers.
      
      Segment customers for marketing and loyalty programs.
      
      Identify top product categories by purchase count.
      
      Visualize monthly sales trends to understand seasonal variations.
      
      Compute Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to identify high-value customers.

**3. Technology and Tools**
        Python – Primary programming language.
        
        Jupyter Notebook – For interactive analysis and visualization.
        
        Pandas – Data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
        
        NumPy – Numerical calculations.
        
        Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization.
        
        Optional tools for expansion:
        
        Power BI / Tableau – For interactive dashboards.
        
        SQL – For querying large datasets from databases.

**4. Dataset**

      File: ecommerce_customer_data_custom_ratios.csv
      
      Columns:
      
      Customer ID – Unique ID for each customer
      
      Product Category – Category of the purchased product
      
      Purchase Date – Date of purchase
      
      Total Purchase Amount – Amount spent on purchase
      
      Size: Small to medium dataset suitable for analytics practice.
      
      Source: Simulated/custom dataset for internship project purposes.

**5. How to Run the Project**

      Clone or download the repository.
      
      Install dependencies:
      
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      
      Run Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive exploration):
      
      jupyter notebook notebooks/customer_analysis.ipynb
      
      
      OR Run Python script for a full analysis:
      
      python scripts/customer_analysis.py


    Explore visualizations of customer segmentation, product categories, monthly sales, and top customers.

**6. Advantages**
      Helps identify high-value customers for loyalty programs.
      
      Reveals best-selling product categories for inventory planning.
      
      Segmented insights enable targeted marketing campaigns.
      
      Visual trends make data easy to interpret for management.

**7. Disadvantages**
      Limited by dataset size – may not reflect all real-world behaviors.
      
      Analysis depends on historical data; may not predict future trends accurately.
      
      Does not include real-time analytics or integration with live sales systems.
      
      Requires basic Python knowledge to run scripts/notebooks.

**8. Future Scope**

        Integrate with real-time sales data for dynamic dashboards.
        
        Expand analysis to geographical regions, demographics, or customer reviews.
        
        Use machine learning models to predict customer churn or purchase trends.
        
        Build a web-based analytics dashboard using Flask/Django for management.

**9. Conclusion**

        This project provides valuable insights into e-commerce customer behavior using data analytics.
        Businesses can use these insights to improve sales, retain high-value customers, plan inventory, and target marketing campaigns more effectively.
        It is a complete beginner-to-intermediate data analytics project, suitable for internships, portfolio building, and real-world business applications.
